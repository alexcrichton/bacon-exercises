# BAcon Exercises

A collection of small exercises to get the creative juices flowing.

Intended to help explore the component model a bit through guest components
running in the browser locally. Ends with a small puzzle which in theory
requires a bit of back-and-forth and interactivity to figure out what's going
on. Builds on the know-how of the previous exercises.
