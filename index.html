  <h2>Component Model Exercises</h2>
  <p>
    Each of the exercises below has a problem where your goal is to upload a
    component and solve the problem at hand. Select an exercise, read it over,
    and then upload a component to execute it via the button below.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each exercise is accompanied with a
    <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/WIT.md">WIT <code>world</code></a>
    which indicates what the "shape" of uploaded components must look like. This
    specifies what can be imported into a component and what must be exported
    from a component. Most exercises work with the "command world" which means
    that a run and/or main function is exported and programs have access to
    utilities like stdio, clocks, randomness, etc. Some interfaces, such as
    WASI sockets, are not available on the web at this time (this is also sort
    of demo quality still).
  </p>
  <p>
    Exercises will log the components output and/or errors to the "Console
    output" section below. The goal of each exercise is to upload a component
    that prints the expected output. If the expected output is not produced or
    an error happens the "red X" will light up. When the exercise is completed
    the green checkmark will light up instead.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're stuck or otherwise are more curious to poke around you can find
    the source code of these exercises <a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/bacon-exercises">online</a>
    which includes example solutions in Rust at this time as well.

    <li class="active"><a data-toggle="tab" href="#hello">Hello, World!</a></li>

    <div id="hello" class="tab-pane in active">
      <h3>Hello, World!</h3>
      <p>
        To learn about components here you need to upload a component which
        prints "Hello, world!", with a newline, to the console.

        Printing should happen via standard language I/O interfaces. The
        <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/WIT.md">WIT <code>world</code></a>
        for available to this exercie's components is below.
      </p>
      <pre>
package example:demo

world hello {
  // ... nothing extra for this exercise
}
<!--
  include <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/crates/wasi/wit/deps/cli/command.wit">wasi:cli/command</a>
-->
</pre>

    </div>
    <div id="hello-name" class="tab-pane in">
      <h3>Hello, $name!</h3>
      <p>
	Now that you've built a single component, let's start exploring the
        component model. Here you're still going to print a greeting, but you
        need to greet someone specific to the test. The way this will be done is
        that you're going to import a function from the outer environment which
        returns a name that you're going to greet.
      </p>
      <p>
	Think of this as a sort of rudimentary plugin system. The
        <code>world</code> below describes the plugin API (just a single
        function) and you're trying to consume this function.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your job is to have a component which prints "Hello, $name!" when the
        "$name" comes from the `who-to-greet` function imported into the
        component. This example will run the component twice to ensure that
        the correct name isn't hardcoded. The name to print is additionally
        randomized each time.
      </p>
      <pre>
package example:demo

world hello-name {
  import who-to-greet: func() -&gt; string
}
</pre>

    </div>

    <div id="hello-structured" class="tab-pane in">
      <h3>{ Hello: "$name!" }</h3>
      <p>
        One of the major features of the component model is the grammar of
        types that you have available to you. For example in addition to
        strings which we've already seen the component model
        supports lists, records, and variants. These map into guest and host
        languages as appropriate for each language.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally the component model supports types called "resources"
        which are handles to a type implemented somewhere else. They're similar
        to file descriptors in Unix and come with static and dynamic guarantees
        about validity and non-forgability in the component model.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this exercise your task is to explore this type structure in the
        component model. The imports into the world need to be consumed to
        create the final output value that your export is supposed to generate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that here you're not going to create a "reactor" unlike in previous
        excercises where a "command" was made instead. There's no
        <code>main</code> function to implement.
      </p>

world demo {
  // This interface, defined below, can be imported into your component. This
  // is used to determine how to implement the export below.
  import greeter-candidates

  // This is what you need to implement.
  export greeter
}

interface greeter-candidates {
  // Calling this function, which is imported into the component, will return
  // a list of candidates which needs to be handled to determine the return
  // value of the exported `greet` function.
  get: func() -&gt; list&lt;candidate&gt;

  variant candidate {
    // This person is a hermit, they prefer to be left alone, don't greet them.
    hermit(person),

    // This person is excited, please greet them.
    excited(person),
  }

  record person {
    // This person's name
    name: string,
    // You're only interested in greeting lego enthusiasts, so require this
    // to be present and greater than zero.
    lego-count: option&lt;u32&gt;,
  }
}

interface greeter {
  // You'll implement this function.
  greet: func() -&gt; result&lt;greeting, error&gt;

    // Manufacture "Hello, $name!" given who you're greeting.
    saying: string,
    // how many legos they claim to have
