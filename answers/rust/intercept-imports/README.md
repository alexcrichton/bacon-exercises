# Intercepting imports

This exercise is meant to be a bit of a puzzle which incorporates what you've
learned about the component model so far. While you can peek at the answer by
looking at the source code here, some leading questions which might also help
you get started are:

* What happens when you run the component in the exercise unmodified?
* What does the exercise's component import? Or export?
* What does it look like the component is basing its decision on of what to
  print?
* Using composition, the theme of this example, can you perhaps wrap the
  component in your own, or the other way around?
